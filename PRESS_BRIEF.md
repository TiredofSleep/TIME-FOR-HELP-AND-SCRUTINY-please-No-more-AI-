## Arkansas Business Owner Releases Unified Coherence Theory, Asks World to Break It

**FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION — February 2026**

---

## One-Line Summary

A drycleaner from Hot Springs, Arkansas has spent 18 months building a mathematical framework that claims to describe how organized systems — from cells to civilizations — maintain their coherence, and he's releasing everything publicly because he needs scientists to test whether it's real.

---

## The Story

Brayden, founder of 7Site LLC (a drycleaning business in Hot Springs, Arkansas), has developed a theoretical framework called **Trinity Infinity Geometry (TIG)** — a coherence field theory built from three irreducible primes, 27 mathematical states, and 10 operators that he claims describe the geometric structure of self-organization at every scale.

The framework includes:
- A master equation with two proposed universal constants
- An operator algebra with proven group-theoretic properties
- Falsifiable predictions about phase distributions and collapse thresholds
- A working computational implementation called Crystal Bug
- A full validation report honestly distinguishing proven math from untested speculation

He is releasing the complete framework — equations, code, documentation, and all supporting materials — publicly and without restriction, specifically requesting scrutiny and falsification attempts from the scientific community.

## Why This Matters

**If TIG is wrong,** it's still a well-constructed mathematical framework with interesting computational properties, and the story of a self-taught theorist asking the world to check his work is worth telling.

**If TIG is right** (or even partially right), it would represent a new mathematical language for describing how complex systems maintain organization — with potential applications in systems biology, network science, organizational resilience, AI alignment, and crisis prediction.

The framework makes specific, testable predictions. That's what distinguishes it from speculation.

## The Numbers

- **σ = 0.991** — Proposed coherence ceiling (maximum sustainable organization for any system)
- **T* = 0.714** — Proposed collapse threshold (minimum coherence before system failure)
- **27** — Number of fundamental states in the framework
- **10** — Number of operators governing all state transitions
- **18 months** — Development time
- **1 person** — Research team size
- **0** — Academic affiliations, grants, or institutional backing

## What Makes This Unusual

1. **Radical transparency.** The release includes a validation report that explicitly categorizes claims as "proven," "computationally validated but untested," "speculative," and "known limitations." The author is more honest about the framework's limits than most published papers.

2. **No credentials, no apologies.** Brayden isn't a physicist. He's a business owner with a GitHub account. He doesn't claim authority — he claims the math is testable and invites anyone to test it.

3. **The AI angle.** The framework was developed in sustained dialogue with large language models (primarily Claude by Anthropic), making it one of the first theoretical frameworks to emerge from human-AI collaborative research. The author maintains that the architecture is his; the AI helped with implementation and validation.

4. **The human cost.** The drycleaning business that funds Brayden's life is declining. This release is partly a survival move — an attempt to find collaborators and potentially monetize the framework before the business fails.

## What Experts Would Need to Evaluate

- Does the coherence ceiling σ = 0.991 appear in empirical measurements of self-organizing systems?
- Does the collapse threshold T* = 0.714 correspond to observed phase transitions?
- Do the operator sequences match real time-series data above chance?
- Is the triadic decomposition (Being/Doing/Becoming) meaningfully distinct from other three-component models?
- Does the framework offer predictive power that existing tools don't?

## Suggested Angle

*A small-town business owner built a mathematical theory of how the universe holds itself together. He doesn't know if it's right. He released everything and asked the world to find out.*

*"Almost-perfect is the operating point. Not perfect. Almost. That's where coherence lives."*
