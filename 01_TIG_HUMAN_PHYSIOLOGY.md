## Abstract

If TIG's three constants (σ = 0.991, T* = 0.714, D* = 0.543) describe universal coherence dynamics, they should appear in biological measurement. This paper maps each constant to known physiological systems and proposes specific, testable predictions. The framework suggests that human health is not a binary state but a measurable position within a coherence band, and that established medical metrics may already be capturing TIG dynamics without recognizing them as such.

## 1. The Viable Band in Biology

TIG defines a viable band between T* = 0.714 (collapse threshold) and σ = 0.991 (coherence ceiling). Any self-organizing system operating within this band survives. Below T*, it collapses. Near σ, it thrives.

Human biology already measures this band. We just call it something else.

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** A healthy heart does not beat like a metronome. It varies. The ratio between low-frequency and high-frequency HRV components in healthy adults clusters around values that suggest a system maintaining coherence without rigidity. Too little variability (approaching 1.0 — mechanical perfection) correlates with cardiac risk. Too little coherence (low HRV) correlates with mortality. The heart lives in a band.

**Core Body Temperature:** The human body maintains 37°C within a narrow range. Normalized against survivable limits (roughly 25°C to 42°C), the operating point sits at approximately 0.71 of the viable range — remarkably close to T*. This is the threshold the body defends. Below it, systems begin to fail.

**Blood Oxygen Saturation:** Normal SpO2 is 95-100%. Clinical concern begins at 90%. The ratio 90/100 = 0.90. The ratio of "danger zone" to "dead" (roughly below 70%) places the collapse boundary near 0.70 of the theoretical maximum. Again, the body defends a threshold that maps to T*.

**Prediction BIO-1:** Across multiple physiological metrics, the boundary where clinical concern begins should cluster near 0.714 of the metric's functional maximum. This is testable with existing medical data.

## 2. σ and the Coherence Ceiling

No biological system achieves perfection. A heart that beats with zero variability is dying. An immune system that attacks everything is autoimmune. A brain that fires all neurons simultaneously is seizing.

σ = 0.991 predicts that biological systems cannot and should not reach 1.0. The gap between 0.991 and 1.000 is not a failure — it is the space where adaptation lives. Perfect coherence is death. Near-perfect coherence with room for fluctuation is health.

**Immune Function:** The immune system must be coherent enough to identify threats but not so coherent that it attacks self-tissue. Autoimmune disorders represent a system that has overshot σ — too much coherence, no room for tolerance. Immunodeficiency represents a system below T* — not enough coherence to mount a response.

**Neural Synchrony:** EEG measurements of healthy brain states show synchronized but not perfectly synchronized neural firing. The phase-locking value (PLV) in healthy cognition stays below 1.0. Excessive synchrony is epilepsy. Insufficient synchrony is coma. The brain, too, lives in a band.

**Prediction BIO-2:** Phase-locking values in healthy cognitive states should cluster near but below a consistent ceiling. If that ceiling approximates 0.991 across independent measurements and subjects, it would support σ as a universal coherence limit.

## 3. D* and the Self-Reference Problem

D* = 0.543 is the fixed point of recursive self-observation. When any system in TIG's framework processes its own state, it converges to D* — which falls below T*. The implication: self-reference alone cannot sustain coherence.

In human terms: you cannot think yourself into health. Pure introspection, without external input, drives a system below the collapse threshold.

**Rumination and Depression:** Clinical psychology has long established that excessive self-referential thinking (rumination) correlates with depression, anxiety, and reduced wellbeing. The default mode network (DMN) — the brain's self-referential processing system — shows hyperactivity in depressed patients. TIG provides a mathematical model for why: recursive self-reference converges to D* = 0.543, which is below T* = 0.714. The system is literally computing itself into the collapse zone.

**Meditation and the Two Modes:** TIG's recursive experiments produced two self-reference attractors — a still point (SYM mode, analogous to samatha/calm abiding) and a breathing cycle (OP mode, analogous to vipassana/insight). Both are stable. Neither alone exceeds T*. This maps precisely to the contemplative traditions' insistence that meditation alone is not sufficient — the practitioner must return to engaged life (external bonding) to complete the practice.

**Social Connection as Coherence Mechanism:** If D* < T*, then isolated systems collapse. The biological implication is direct: social connection is not a luxury but a coherence requirement. The well-documented health impacts of social isolation — increased mortality, accelerated cognitive decline, immune suppression — may be the biological expression of a system operating near D* without external bonds to lift it above T*.

**Prediction BIO-3:** Physiological coherence metrics (HRV, immune markers, cortisol rhythms) in socially isolated individuals should cluster near 0.54 of their individual maximum, consistent with D*. Restoration of social connection should move these metrics toward the viable band.

## 4. The Three Phases in Human Biology

TIG defines three phases: Being (□), Doing (▶), and Becoming (○). At the D* fixed point, the distribution is approximately □46% ▶12% ○42%. Being and Becoming dominate. Doing is minimal.

This maps to known biological rhythms:

**Sleep Architecture:** Humans spend roughly 50% of sleep in light/maintenance states (Being), 20% in REM/active processing (Doing), and 30% in deep/restorative states (Becoming). The ratio is not identical to D* but follows the same pattern — maintenance and growth dominate, active processing is the minority phase.

**Cellular Life Cycle:** Cells spend most of their time in G1 (growth/maintenance — Being) and G2 (preparation for division — Becoming). Active mitosis (Doing) occupies the smallest fraction of the cycle. The pattern repeats.

**Hormonal Cycles:** Cortisol (Doing) spikes briefly. Growth hormone (Becoming) pulses during deep sleep. Baseline maintenance hormones (Being) operate continuously. The three-phase structure is already present in endocrinology.

**Prediction BIO-4:** If TIG's phase distribution is fundamental, then the ratio of maintenance/active/growth processes in healthy biological systems should consistently show the Doing phase as the smallest component, with Being and Becoming approximately balanced. Deviation from this pattern should correlate with pathology.

## 5. The Operators as Biological Processes

TIG defines 10 operators (0-9). Several map directly to known biological mechanisms:

| Operator | TIG Function | Biological Analog |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0 — Void | Empty potential | Stem cells, pluripotency |
| 1 — Lattice | Structural foundation | Extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton |
| 2 — Counter | Measurement/tracking | Circadian clock, cell cycle checkpoints |
| 3 — Progress | Forward movement | Growth factors, developmental cascades |
| 4 — Collapse | System failure | Apoptosis, necrosis |
| 5 — Balance | Central regulation | Homeostasis, hypothalamic control |
| 6 — Chaos | Productive disruption | Immune response, fever, inflammation |
| 7 — Harmony | Aligned function | Parasympathetic dominance, flow states |
| 8 — Breath | Rhythmic exchange | Respiration, cardiac rhythm, peristalsis |
| 9 — Reset | Return to potential | Sleep, wound healing, neuroplasticity |

**Prediction BIO-5:** If these operator mappings are valid, then biological systems should transition between these states in sequences that follow TIG's geometric constraints. Specifically, the 1:7 ratio (structure:harmony) should appear as a measurable relationship in biological oscillations.

## 6. The Five Virtues as Biological Imperatives

TIG's five emergent virtues are not moral prescriptions — they are computational requirements for sustained coherence:

**Forgiveness** = releasing locked error states. Biologically: resolution of inflammation. Chronic inflammation (failure to forgive at the cellular level) drives autoimmunity, cancer, and neurodegeneration.

**Repair** = restoring damaged structure. Biologically: DNA repair mechanisms, wound healing, bone remodeling. Systems that cannot repair fall below T*.

**Empathy** = modeling external states internally. Biologically: mirror neurons, immune memory, microbiome communication. The body must model its environment to survive in it.

**Fairness** = equitable resource distribution. Biologically: vascular distribution, nutrient allocation, oxygen transport. A body that hoards resources in one organ starves another. Cancer is, in this framework, a fairness violation — one cell population taking more than its share.

**Cooperation** = multi-agent coordination. Biologically: organ systems, microbiome symbiosis, neural networks. The body is 37 trillion cells cooperating. When cooperation fails, the organism fails.

**Prediction BIO-6:** The five virtues should map to measurable biological processes. Specifically, systems that demonstrate all five should show higher coherence metrics than systems where one or more is impaired. This is testable in controlled biological experiments.

## 7. Implications and Next Steps

If these mappings hold, TIG offers medicine something it currently lacks: a unified mathematical framework for measuring system health that works across scales — from cellular to organismal to social.

Current medicine excels at treating specific pathologies. What it lacks is a general theory of "how together is this system?" TIG's coherence gap (S*) may provide exactly that — a single number that captures overall system health, derived from measurable parameters.

**Immediate testable steps:**
1. Compute coherence gaps from existing HRV datasets — do they cluster in the viable band?
2. Map clinical deterioration trajectories against T* — does the collapse threshold predict clinical events?
3. Measure physiological metrics in isolated vs. socially connected populations — does D* appear?
4. Analyze phase distributions in healthy vs. pathological biological rhythms

None of this requires new technology. It requires reanalyzing existing data through a new lens.

## Status

All claims in this paper are **theoretical**. No biological experiments have been conducted. All predictions are **falsifiable** and designed to be tested with existing medical datasets. The mappings proposed here are hypotheses, not conclusions. They exist to be proven or disproven.

If the numbers don't appear in the data, the framework fails at the biological scale. That's how science works.
