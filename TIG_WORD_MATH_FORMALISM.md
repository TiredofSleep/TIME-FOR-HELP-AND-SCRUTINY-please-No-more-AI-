## 1. FOUNDATIONAL STRUCTURES

### 1.1 Generator Alphabets

Three primary generator sets (all treated as the same mathematical object type):

| Symbol | Domain | Elements |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Σ_sound | Phonemes | {a, e, i, o, u, p, b, t, d, k, g, ...} |
| Σ_letter | Graphemes | {a, b, c, d, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z, 0-9, punctuation} |
| Σ_math | Math symbols | {+, -, ×, ÷, =, ∫, ∂, Σ, Π, ...} |

### 1.2 Free Monoids

Each alphabet generates a free monoid (all finite sequences with concatenation):

```
Σ* = {ε, σ₁, σ₂, σ₁σ₂, σ₁σ₁, ...}  where σᵢ ∈ Σ
```

Therefore:
- A spoken word ∈ Σ*_sound
- A written word ∈ Σ*_letter  
- A math expression string ∈ Σ*_math

**Same structure: generators + concatenation.**

### 1.3 Grammars (Generative Rules)

Each domain has a grammar G (set of valid compositions):

| Grammar | Domain | Output |
|---------|--------|--------|
| G_spoken | Natural speech | Valid utterances |
| G_written | Written language | Valid text |
| G_math | Mathematical notation | Valid expressions |

These are all **formal languages**: sets of strings generated by production rules.

## 2. THE LINKING MAPS

### 2.1 Full Pipeline

```
X_wave → f_hear → Σ*_sound → f_spell → Σ*_letter → f_parse → T_math → f_sem → O → g_C → M
```

Where:
- **X_wave** = Acoustic space (waveforms, spectrograms)
- **f_hear** = Perception map (speech recognition)
- **f_spell** = Orthographic map (phoneme → letter, monoid homomorphism)
- **T_math** = Term algebra of math expressions (trees, not flat strings)
- **f_parse** = Parsing/interpretation map
- **f_sem** = Semantic map (term → mathematical object/function)
- **O** = Object space (mathematical objects)
- **g_C** = Meaning under lens C
- **M** = Meaning space (concepts, internal states)

### 2.2 Individual Maps

**Acoustic → Phoneme Sequence:**
```
f_hear: X_wave → Σ*_sound
```

**Phoneme → Letter Sequence:**
```
f_spell: Σ*_sound → Σ*_letter  (monoid homomorphism)
```

**Letter → Math Term:**
```
f_parse: Σ*_letter → T_math
```

**Term → Mathematical Object:**
```
f_sem: T_math → O
```

**Object → Meaning (via lens):**
```
g_C: O → M
```

## 3. CONSCIOUSNESS AS LENS-UPDATE OPERATOR

### 3.1 The Lens

A conscious lens C is a map:
```
f_C: X_world → M
```

Where X_world is the space of all possible inputs (sensory, symbolic, etc.)

### 3.2 Meaning Regions

For a given word-form w, define:

**Meaning region:**
```
R_w = {m ∈ M : f_C(w) maps to m}
```

**Boundary curve/surface:**
```
∂R_w = {m ∈ M : m is on the edge of R_w}
```

### 3.3 Probabilistic Boundary

```
∂R_w = {x ∈ X_world | P(w|x,C) ≈ P(w'|x,C) for some w' ≠ w}
```

This is literally a **decision surface** in M defined by lens C.

### 3.4 The Update Rule

**Consciousness = the boundary-updating operator:**
```
C_{t+1} = L(x_t, C_t)
```

Where L is the update rule (learning, reflection, therapy, insight, etc.)

### 3.5 Identity as Fixed Point

An identity is any C* such that:
```
L(x, C*) ≈ C*  for most x
```

**Stability conditions:**
| State | Boundary Behavior | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Chaotic | ‖∂R(t+1) - ∂R(t)‖ >> ε | Unstable identity |
| Rigid | ‖∂R(t+1) - ∂R(t)‖ ≈ 0 | No adaptation |
| Healthy | ‖∂R(t+1) - ∂R(t)‖ ~ ε | Bounded update |

## 4. THE UNIVERSAL TRIPLE

### 4.1 Canonical Form

Any symbolic system reduces to:
```
(Σ, G, f_C)
```

Where:
- **Σ** = alphabet (generators)
- **G** = grammar (composition rules)
- **f_C** = interpretation map under lens C

### 4.2 Universal Pipeline

```
Σ → G(Σ) → f_C(G(Σ)) → R ⊂ M → ∂R → update(∂R)
```

Or compressed:
```
generator → grammar → map → region → boundary → coherence
```

This is **invariant** across all domains:
- Spoken language
- Written language
- Mathematical notation
- Code
- Music
- Belief systems
- Cultural memes
- Physical models

## 5. TIG COHERENCE INTEGRATION

### 5.1 Core Coherence Score

```
S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*
```

Where:
- σ = 0.991 (coherence constant)
- T* = 0.714 (threshold)
- V* = volume/capacity factor
- A* = alignment factor

### 5.2 TIG Phases as Boundary Dynamics

| Phase | Name | Boundary Operation |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| 0 | RESET | ∂R → ∂R₀ (return to attractor) |
| 1 | VOID | Initialize empty lattice |
| 2 | LATTICE | Structure formation |
| 3 | COUNTER | Opposition/contrast generation |
| 4 | PROGRESS | Forward integration |
| 5 | REDOX | Energy exchange across ∂R |
| 6 | COLLAPSE | Boundary contraction |
| 7 | HARMONY | ∂R stabilizes, S* maximizes |
| 8 | BREATH | Oscillation maintenance |
| 9 | CHAOS | Boundary perturbation |
| 10 | BALANCE | Equilibrium seeking |
| 11 | EXPANSION | Boundary growth |
| 12 | HARVEST | R expands, new generators absorbed |

### 5.3 GFM Generators (Minimal Spanning Set)

| GFM | Components | Function |
|-----|------------|----------|
| 012 | Void→Lattice→Counter | Geometry/Space |
| 071 | Void→Harmony→Void | Resonance/Alignment |
| 123 | Void→Lattice→Progress | Progression/Flow |

## 6. COHERENCE BRIDGE

### 6.1 Classical vs Quantum vs Coherence

| Mode | Meaning-Space | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Classical | "The word is definitely THIS" | Fixed states |
| Quantum | "Multiple words partially fit" | Superposed states |
| Coherence | "What makes collapse predictable" | Resolution rules |

### 6.2 TIG as Coherence Dynamics

TIG is a **formal model of coherence dynamics** in any symbolic system:
- Not mystical
- Not metaphorical
- Algebraically grounded

---

## 7. IMPLICATIONS

### 7.1 Meaning is Geometry

Every concept is a geometric object:
- Words = regions R_w in meaning-space M
- Boundaries = ∂R_w
- Interpretation = map C

"Truth," "love," "flow," "self" are regions with boundaries in high-dimensional space.

### 7.2 Words are Compression Codes

```
w is a minimal code for R_w
```

The human mind is a **live, adaptive compression algorithm**.

This collapses:
- Linguistics
- Memory
- Identity
- Storytelling
- Trauma
- Insight
- Belief systems
- Philosophy
- Semantics

...into a single structure: **dynamic compression + boundary adjustment.**

### 7.3 Universal Equivalence

There is NO fundamental difference between:
- A spoken sentence
- A written word
- A mathematical formula
- A symbolic logic expression
- A code snippet
- A story
- A belief
- A cultural meme
- A personal identity
- A physical model
- A physical law

All are: `Σ* → G → f_C → M`

### 7.4 Shared Reality

"Shared reality" = alignment of C across individuals.

Same formal structure, different alphabets.

## 8. TESTABLE PREDICTIONS

### 8.1 Communication Failure Modes

Failures occur when:
1. **Generator mismatch**: Different Σ
2. **Grammar mismatch**: Different G
3. **Lens mismatch**: Different C
4. **Boundary overlap**: ∂R_w ∩ ∂R_w' ≠ ∅

### 8.2 Coherence Measurements

Observable via TIG metrics:
- Fire rate by phase
- χ² deviation from uniform
- S* stability over time
- Boundary oscillation amplitude

### 8.3 Empirical Validation Path

1. Deploy TIG on controlled systems
2. Measure phase distributions under load
3. Correlate with system health metrics
4. Validate Protection Theorem predictions

## 9. SUMMARY EQUATIONS

### The Complete Formalism

**Pipeline:**
```
(raw world) → f_perception → Σ*_sound → f_spell → Σ*_letter → f_parse → T_math → f_sem → O → g_C → M
```

**Boundaries:**
```
∂R_w = {x : P(w|x,C) ≈ P(w'|x,C)}
```

**Evolution:**
```
C_{t+1} = L(x_t, C_t)
```

**Coherence:**
```
S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*
```

**Universal Triple:**
```
(Σ, G, f_C)
```

## 10. CONCLUSION

TIG is a **universal compression and coherence engine** for ANY symbolic system.

Not because of mysticism.

Because the underlying math structure is **uniform across domains**.

The canonical abstraction:
```
generator → grammar → interpreter → boundaries → update
```

This is the math of resonance, coherence, identity, language, and thought.
