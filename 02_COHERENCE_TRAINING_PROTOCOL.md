## Abstract

If TIG describes how coherence works in any self-organizing system, then humans are self-organizing systems that can consciously influence their own coherence. This paper translates TIG's mathematical framework into a practical protocol for daily life. It is not self-help. It is applied mathematics. Every recommendation traces back to a specific TIG principle with a falsifiable prediction about outcomes.

## 1. The Core Equation Applied to You

S* = σ(1 - σ*)V*A*

Where:
- **S*** is your current coherence (how "together" you are right now)
- **σ** = 0.991 is the ceiling (you will never be perfect, and that's correct)
- **σ*** is your current gap from coherence (how far from your best)
- **V*** is your structural integrity (your foundation, habits, body)
- **A*** is your active engagement (what you're doing with what you have)

This equation says your coherence is the product of your structure and your action, regulated by a ceiling you cannot exceed and a gap you can close. You influence V* and A*. The math handles the rest.

## 2. Know Your Position

Before changing anything, you need to know where you are in the band.

**Below T* (0.714) — Collapse Zone**
Signs: chronic exhaustion, inability to maintain routines, withdrawal from relationships, physical illness accumulating, nothing feels like it works. Your system is below the threshold. Triage, not optimization.

**Between T* and σ (0.714 – 0.991) — Viable Band**
Signs: functional but stressed, some routines holding, some relationships intact, capacity to improve. You're alive in the band. Optimization is possible.

**Near D* (0.543) — Self-Reference Trap**
Signs: excessive rumination, isolation, overthinking without action, paralysis by analysis, stuck in your own head. You're recursing. You need external input, not more thinking.

**Assessment questions:**
- Am I maintaining basic structure? (sleep, food, hygiene, shelter) → V*
- Am I engaging with anything outside myself? (work, people, projects) → A*
- Am I mostly thinking about myself thinking about myself? → D* trap

## 3. Protocol for the Collapse Zone (Below T*)

If you're below T*, the goal is survival, not growth. TIG says systems below the collapse threshold need structure first.

**Operator 1 — Lattice (build structure):**
- Fix one routine. Not five. One. Sleep at the same time every night.
- This is V*. Without structure, A* has nothing to multiply.

**Operator 5 — Balance (find center):**
- Reduce inputs. Fewer decisions, fewer stimuli, fewer obligations.
- A collapsing system cannot process complexity. Simplify.

**Operator 8 — Breath (rhythmic exchange):**
- Literal breathing. Box breathing (4-4-4-4) imposes rhythmic structure on a chaotic system.
- This is the biological equivalent of resetting the clock operator.

**The rule:** Below T*, add structure. Do not add goals, ambitions, or self-improvement programs. The lattice comes first.

**Prediction CTP-1:** Individuals below T* who focus exclusively on structural interventions (sleep hygiene, meal timing, single-routine establishment) should show measurable improvements in HRV and cortisol regulation within 2-4 weeks, faster than those who attempt comprehensive lifestyle changes.

## 4. Protocol for the Self-Reference Trap (Near D*)

D* = 0.543 is where you end up when you only look at yourself. The math is clear: self-reference converges below T*. You cannot think your way out. You need external bonds.

**The D* escape protocol:**

**Step 1 — Recognize the loop.**
If you've been thinking about the same problem for more than 48 hours without new external input, you're at D*. The loop will not resolve internally.

**Step 2 — Break the recursion with external contact.**
Call someone. Not text. Voice. The bandwidth of a voice call is higher than text — more signal, more external coherence to bond with. TIG says coherence requires external bonding. This is not a metaphor.

**Step 3 — Do something physical.**
The OP chain (purposive self-reference) oscillates through collapse and reset. Physical action breaks the cycle because it forces the Doing phase (▶) above its D* minimum of 12%. Move your body. The phase distribution shifts.

**Step 4 — Contribute to someone else's coherence.**
Help someone with their problem. This forces your computation outward. You become the external bond for another system. TIG's virtues emerge from this: empathy (modeling their state), cooperation (working together), repair (fixing something broken).

**The rule:** At D*, go outward. Every minute spent in self-analysis past the recognition point is wasted computation.

**Prediction CTP-2:** Self-reported rumination scores should inversely correlate with frequency of voice-based social contact and physical activity. Interventions that increase both simultaneously should reduce rumination faster than either alone.

## 5. Protocol for the Viable Band (T* to σ)

You're in the band. You're functional. Now you optimize.

**The 10-Operator Daily Cycle:**

TIG defines 10 operators that cycle from void (0) to reset (9). A coherent day touches all of them:

**Morning — Operators 0-3 (Emergence)**
- 0 (Void): Wake. The moment before intention. Don't check your phone.
- 1 (Lattice): Morning routine. Same sequence, same structure. This is your foundation.
- 2 (Counter): Assess. What needs to happen today? Measure your state.
- 3 (Progress): First meaningful action. Start the thing that matters most.

**Midday — Operators 4-6 (Negotiation)**
- 4 (Collapse): Something will go wrong. Accept it. Collapse is an operator, not a failure. Let the thing that isn't working fail so resources can redirect.
- 5 (Balance): Pause. Eat. Check in. Are you still centered or have you drifted?
- 6 (Chaos): The productive disruption. Do the thing that's uncomfortable. Make the call you've been avoiding. Chaos is necessary for growth.

**Evening — Operators 7-9 (Resolution)**
- 7 (Harmony): Do something you're good at. Flow state. Alignment. This is where A* peaks.
- 8 (Breath): Wind down. Rhythmic activity. Walk, cook, play music. Exchange energy with your environment.
- 9 (Reset): Sleep. Full reset. The system returns to potential for the next cycle.

**The rule:** A day that skips operators accumulates debt. A day that consistently skips the same operator develops pathology. If you never allow collapse (4), you become brittle. If you never reach harmony (7), you burn out. If you never reset (9), you degrade.

**Prediction CTP-3:** Individuals who consciously structure daily activity to include all 10 operator phases should show higher HRV coherence scores than those with unstructured routines, independent of the specific activities chosen.

## 6. The 1:7 Ratio in Practice

TIG's fundamental ratio is 1:7 — one unit of structure supports seven units of function. In practice:

**Time allocation:** For every 1 hour spent maintaining structure (planning, organizing, cleaning, repairing), you can sustain 7 hours of productive function. If you're spending 3 hours a day on maintenance, your system supports roughly 21 hours of total function — which is close to a full waking day.

**Relationships:** For every 1 deep relationship you maintain (high bandwidth, high coherence), you can sustain approximately 7 functional relationships. This is remarkably consistent with anthropological data on social network layers.

**Skill development:** For every 1 foundational skill you master deeply, approximately 7 derivative skills become accessible. Depth before breadth.

**The rule:** When in doubt, invest in structure. The return is 7x.

**Prediction CTP-4:** The 1:7 ratio should appear in time-use studies as an optimal allocation between maintenance and productive activities. Deviation in either direction should correlate with reduced self-reported wellbeing and measurable coherence metrics.

## 7. The Five Virtues as Health Practices

The five TIG virtues are not moral imperatives — they are coherence maintenance operations. Neglecting any one degrades the system.

**Forgiveness Practice:**
Release one grudge, resentment, or self-criticism per week. Not because it's noble — because locked error states consume computational resources. Chronic resentment is a memory leak in your biological operating system.

Metric: Write it down, then destroy the paper. The physical act completes the release operation.

**Repair Practice:**
Fix one broken thing per week. A relationship, a habit, a literal object in your house. Unrepaired damage accumulates below conscious awareness and drags V* downward.

Metric: Maintain a repair list. Track completion rate. A declining repair rate signals system degradation.

**Empathy Practice:**
Model someone else's internal state once per day. Not sympathy ("I feel bad for you") — empathy ("I am computing what it's like to be you"). This is external bonding. This is how you escape D*.

Metric: Can you articulate another person's position in terms they would agree with? If not, the model needs work.

**Fairness Practice:**
Audit resource distribution weekly. Are you giving disproportionate time, energy, or attention to one area of life while starving another? A system that hoards resources in one subsystem is growing a tumor.

Metric: Time tracking across life domains. Look for ratios more extreme than 3:1.

**Cooperation Practice:**
Collaborate on something weekly. Not delegation — actual shared computation. Two systems bonding produce coherence that neither can achieve alone. This is the mathematical basis of teamwork, partnership, and community.

Metric: Hours spent in genuine collaborative work vs. solo work. If the ratio drops below 1:7, you're approaching isolation.

**Prediction CTP-5:** Individuals who consistently practice all five virtues should show measurably higher coherence metrics (HRV, sleep quality, immune markers) than those who practice four or fewer, regardless of which one is missing.

## 8. What This Is Not

This is not a replacement for medical care. If you are sick, see a doctor.

This is not a guarantee. The framework predicts tendencies, not certainties.

This is not spiritual practice dressed in math. It is math that happens to align with things contemplative traditions have said for millennia. The math came first. The alignment is either coincidence or evidence. Testing will determine which.

This is not self-help. Self-help says "believe and you'll be fine." TIG says "your self-reference converges to 0.543 and you need external bonds to survive." Those are different claims.

## 9. Summary

| If you're here | Do this | TIG principle |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Below T* (collapsing) | Build one structure | Operator 1 (Lattice) |
| At D* (stuck in your head) | Go outward — call, move, help | D* < T*, external bonds required |
| In the viable band | Cycle all 10 operators daily | Complete operator coverage |
| Plateaued | Invest in structure at 1:7 | Fundamental ratio |
| Declining slowly | Audit the five virtues | Coherence maintenance |

The math says you can't reach 1.0 and shouldn't try. The math says you can't stay above T* alone. The math says your structure determines your ceiling.

Build the lattice. Bond with others. Cycle through all the operators. Let collapse happen when it needs to. Reset every night.

That's the protocol.
