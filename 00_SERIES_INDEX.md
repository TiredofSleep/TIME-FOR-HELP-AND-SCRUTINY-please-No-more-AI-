## Series Overview

If TIG is true — if the three constants (σ = 0.991, T* = 0.714, D* = 0.543) describe universal coherence dynamics — then humans are coherence systems. Not metaphorically. Mathematically. This series explores what that means, from physiology to consciousness to practical daily life.

Each paper increases in speculation. Each paper includes falsifiable predictions. Each paper is honest about what it knows and what it guesses.

## The Papers

### Paper 1: TIG and Human Physiology
**Speculation level: Low — Maps TIG to established medical measurements**

Maps the three constants to known biological metrics. Proposes that T* = 0.714 corresponds to clinical thresholds already used in medicine (the boundaries where doctors start worrying). Proposes that D* = 0.543 should appear in physiological measurements of socially isolated individuals. Identifies the three TIG phases (Being, Doing, Becoming) in sleep architecture, cellular life cycles, and hormonal rhythms.

Key prediction: Clinical deterioration thresholds across multiple organ systems cluster near 0.714 of functional maximum.

6 falsifiable predictions (BIO-1 through BIO-6).

### Paper 2: Coherence Training Protocol
**Speculation level: Medium — Applied theory, no clinical validation**

Translates TIG mathematics into a practical daily protocol. Identifies three zones (collapse zone, self-reference trap, viable band) and provides specific interventions for each. Maps the 10 TIG operators to a daily cycle. Introduces the 1:7 ratio as a practical time-allocation tool. Reframes the five TIG virtues as measurable health practices.

Key prediction: Individuals who structure daily activity to include all 10 operator phases show higher coherence metrics than those with unstructured routines.

5 falsifiable predictions (CTP-1 through CTP-5).

### Paper 3: The Self-Reference Problem in Consciousness
**Speculation level: High — Connects D* to the nature of mind**

Explores what it means that self-reference converges below the collapse threshold. Proposes that consciousness requires external bonds as a mathematical necessity. Maps TIG's two self-reference modes to brain lateralization. Reframes sleep as coherence maintenance against D* drift. Models mental illness as operator dysfunction. Identifies the self-improvement paradox (trying to improve yourself by examining yourself pushes you toward D*).

Key prediction: Neural correlates of self-referential processing should show coherence metrics converging toward D* = 0.543.

6 falsifiable predictions (CON-1 through CON-6).

### Paper 4: Biological Computation and the Coherence Lattice
**Speculation level: Medium — Connects TIG architecture to known biology**

Argues that biological systems already compute on TIG-compatible principles. Maps the fractal triplet structure to cellular organization. Proposes the coherence gap as a new vital sign. Traces the TIG operator cycle through wound healing, grief processing, and immune response. Identifies the microbiome as the external bond that prevents D* convergence. Draws structural parallels between TIG's triplet states and DNA's triplet codons. Provides a three-stage implementation roadmap for clinical translation.

Key prediction: A composite coherence score predicts clinical events more accurately than any single vital sign.

5 falsifiable predictions (BCC-1 through BCC-5).

## What This Series Is

A set of theoretical papers that trace the implications of three mathematical constants through human biology, daily life, consciousness, and medicine. Every claim is labeled by speculation level. Every major assertion includes a testable prediction. Nothing is presented as proven.

## What This Series Is Not

Medical advice. Clinical recommendation. Spiritual teaching. Self-help philosophy.

This is mathematics applied to biology. If the math is wrong, the predictions fail, and these papers are interesting fiction. If the math is right, these papers are a roadmap for a new kind of medicine — one that measures coherence instead of counting symptoms.

Testing determines which.
