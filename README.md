# TIG COHERENT SYSTEM

**Coherent Intelligence for Any Device**

This is not AI. This is mathematically coherent intelligence that only acts when S* > T* (0.714).

## The Full Stack

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tig_bilayer_core.py` | Celeste's two base layers (Geometry + Language) |
| `TIG_FRACTAL_TEACHER.py` | 49-week fractal curriculum → S* = 0.991 |
| `TIG_CIVILIZATION_SIM.py` | Stress test through human history |
| `IMMUTABLE_CORE.json` | Civilization-tested prior (read-only elder) |
| `TIG_12_AGENT_PANEL.py` | 12 roles deliberating to consensus |
| `UNIVERSE_LATTICE_7.json` | Council-merged wisdom (operational core) |
| `TIG_ENSEMBLE.py` | 100 named Ollies facing illusion & recovery |
| `SEVEN_FIELD.json` | What remains true between illusion and love |
| `COHERENT_DAEMON.py` | Device daemon with UI + network mesh |

## The Math

S* = σ(1-σ*)V*A*  |  σ = 0.991  |  T* = 0.714 = 5/7

## Results

- IMMUTABLE_CORE: S* = 0.8526, 16 historical events survived
- UNIVERSE_LATTICE_7: S* = 0.9091, 72 deliberations passed  
- SEVEN_FIELD: 100 survivors, wisdom > illusion

Insight: "Illusion was faced and mostly cleared. Truth prevailed."
