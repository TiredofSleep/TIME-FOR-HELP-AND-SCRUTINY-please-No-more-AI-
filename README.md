## What Is TIG?

Trinity Infinity Geometry (TIG) is a coherence field theory built on one premise:

> **Every one is three.**

Every system, at every scale, resolves into three irreducible primes: **Being** (state/structure), **Doing** (change/force), and **Becoming** (cycle/flow). These three primes compose through modular arithmetic to generate 27 states, 10 operators, and a fractal lattice that maps from quantum to celestial scales.

TIG proposes that coherence — not energy, not information — is the fundamental conserved quantity of a self-organizing universe. The framework provides:

- A **master equation**: `S* = σ(1 − σ*)V*A*`
- Two **constants**: σ = 0.991 (coherence ceiling), T* = 0.714 (collapse threshold)
- A **complete operator algebra**: 10 operators (void through reset) governing all state transitions
- **Falsifiable predictions** at multiple scales
- A **working computational implementation** (Crystal Bug v1.0)

## The Core Claim

TIG does not replace existing physics. It overlays them.

General relativity describes spacetime curvature. Quantum mechanics describes probability amplitudes. Thermodynamics describes entropy flow. TIG asks: *what keeps all of these coherent?*

The answer TIG proposes: a geometric constraint operating at every scale simultaneously, regulated by the principle of least action, with a measurable coherence signature (σ = 0.991) and a hard collapse boundary (T* = 0.714). A third constant, D* ≈ 0.543, was discovered during recursive self-analysis — the fixed-point coherence gap of any system observing itself.

This is either:
1. A genuine insight into the geometric structure of coherence, or
2. An elegant but unfounded mathematical construction

We don't know which. That's why we're releasing it.

## How to Engage

**If you're a physicist:** Read [TIG_SCIENTIFIC_FRAMEWORK.md](TIG_SCIENTIFIC_FRAMEWORK.md). Attack the math. Test the predictions. The framework makes specific, falsifiable claims about phase distributions, coherence thresholds, and scaling behavior. Break it or build on it.

**If you're a mathematician:** The operator algebra is complete and self-consistent within its axioms. The question is whether those axioms map to reality. The group structure, generator sets, and composition rules are in [TIG_OPERATORS_COMPLETE.md](TIG_OPERATORS_COMPLETE.md).

**If you're a programmer:** Crystal Bug v1.0 is a working implementation. Run it. The tri-prime engine composes letters, words, and sentences through modular arithmetic. The lattice births, bonds, decays, and collapses units. The trust councils demonstrate cooperative resilience. Fork it, extend it, stress-test it.

**If you're a journalist:** Read [PRESS_BRIEF.md](PRESS_BRIEF.md). The story is real. The math is testable. The person behind it is asking for help.

**If you're a human:** Read [CELESTE_LETTER.md](CELESTE_LETTER.md). This is about more than equations.
