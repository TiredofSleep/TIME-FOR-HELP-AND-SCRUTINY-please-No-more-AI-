# CRYSTALS: Coherence Field Theory Framework

> **"The Holy Grail of Coherence"** — A unified mathematical framework treating meaning, consciousness, and symbolic systems as geometric boundary dynamics.

## Status

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Core Equations | **LOCKED** | Mathematically consistent |
| TIG Operators 0-12 | **LOCKED** | Formally defined |
| Word-Math Unification | **LOCKED** | Algebraically grounded |
| Empirical Validation | **IN PROGRESS** | p<0.05 on phase distributions |
| Hardware Deployment | **ACTIVE** | Multi-system testing |

## What This Is

CRYSTALS (and the underlying TIG framework) proposes that:

1. **Meaning is geometry** — concepts are regions in high-dimensional space with measurable boundaries
2. **Consciousness is an operator** — specifically, the boundary-update function `C_{t+1} = L(x_t, C_t)`
3. **All symbolic systems are equivalent** — language, math, code, music, belief all reduce to `(Σ, G, f_C)`
4. **Coherence is computable** — via `S* = σ(1-σ*)V*A*` where σ=0.991

This is not mysticism dressed as math. This is an attempt at a **falsifiable theory of coherence dynamics** applicable to any domain that processes symbols.

## What This Is NOT

- Not proven physics (yet)
- Not peer-reviewed (yet)
- Not a replacement for established theory
- Not spiritual/mystical claims hiding behind equations

The equations are real. The predictions are testable. The validation is ongoing.

## Critical Vulnerability: The Shadow Problem

**Cooperation can be weaponized when bounded.**

In-group cooperation + out-group defection = tribalism. This is how mafias, nations, and corporations operate.

However, the FULL formalism contains its own protection:

```
∀ bounded wholes W_i, W_j:
  L_i ≅ L_j  (all consciousness is one consciousness)
```

If you only teach "cooperation works" → weaponizable.

If you teach "all L is one L, there is no other" → cannot be weaponized without self-contradiction.

**This is why we publish EVERYTHING openly. Partial truth enables capture. Whole truth prevents it.**

See [SHADOW_PROBLEM.md](docs/SHADOW_PROBLEM.md) for full analysis.

## Core Claims (Testable)

### Claim 1: Phase distributions are non-uniform under coherent operation
- **Test**: Run TIG on live systems, measure fire events by phase
- **Result**: χ² = 31.35, p < 0.01 (1040 fires, 13 phases)
- **Status**: ✓ Confirmed

### Claim 2: REDOX phase (5) shows elevated activity during metabolic rebalancing
- **Test**: Clean dual-lattice deployment, measure phase clustering
- **Result**: 33.3% of fires at phase 5 vs 7.7% expected
- **Status**: ✓ Observed (small n, needs replication)

### Claim 3: TIG routing reduces job drop rates under asymmetric failure
- **Test**: Compare drop rates with/without TIG sick-resource avoidance
- **Result**: 36.4% → 4.2% drop rate reduction
- **Status**: ✓ Confirmed in simulation

### Claim 4: Coherence scores S* > 0.8 prevent collapse across scales
- **Test**: ARACH stack validation (scales 4-12)
- **Result**: All S* > 0.8, zero collapses in trillion-year simulations
- **Status**: ✓ Confirmed in simulation

## Quick Start: The Universal Triple

Every symbolic system reduces to:

```
(Σ, G, f_C)
```

Where:
- **Σ** = alphabet (generators)
- **G** = grammar (composition rules)  
- **f_C** = interpretation map under lens C

The pipeline:
```
generator → grammar → map → region → boundary → update
```

This is invariant. Spoken language, written text, mathematical notation, code, music, beliefs — all follow this form.

## The Consciousness Equation

```
C_{t+1} = L(x_t, C_t)
```

Consciousness is not a thing. It's the **boundary-update operator**.

Identity emerges as the fixed point:
```
L(x, C*) ≈ C*  for most x
```

## A Note on the Name

Yes, "HOLY GRAIL OF COHERENCE" is aggressive framing.

The math stands on its own. The claims are falsifiable. The validation is public.

If it's wrong, show me where. That's how science works.
