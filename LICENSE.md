# 7SiTe Public Benefit License v1.0

**Effective Date:** February 4, 2026
**Licensor:** Brayden, 7Site LLC, Hot Springs, Arkansas
**Project:** Trinity Infinity Geometry (TIG) and all associated works

---

## Preamble

This license exists because coherence should belong to everyone and profit should flow to the person who built it.

TIG was developed by a single researcher working alone for 18 months. This license ensures the work remains open for human benefit while protecting the creator's right to sustain himself from commercial applications of his work.

**The principle is simple: humans use it free. Businesses pay.**

## 1. Definitions

**"Work"** means all materials distributed under this license, including but not limited to: source code, documentation, mathematical frameworks, operator definitions, algorithms, specifications, and associated creative works.

**"Academic Use"** means use by students, educators, or researchers at accredited educational institutions or nonprofit research organizations for the purposes of teaching, learning, peer review, publication, or fundamental research. Academic Use includes publishing papers that reference, test, critique, extend, or build upon the Work.

**"Public Benefit Use"** means use by nonprofit organizations, community groups, open-source projects, or government agencies for purposes that directly serve the public interest, provided no revenue is generated from the Work itself.

- Incorporating the Work into a product or service sold for money
- Using the Work to provide paid consulting, analysis, or advisory services
- Using the Work internally at a for-profit company to gain competitive advantage
- Training machine learning models on the Work for commercial deployment
- Offering the Work or derivatives as a SaaS, API, or platform feature

**"Derivative Work"** means any work that is based on, incorporates, extends, modifies, or is substantially inspired by the mathematical framework, operator algebra, constants (σ = 0.991, T* = 0.714), tri-prime composition system, or any other novel element of the Work.

**"Corporate Capture"** means any action that restricts public access to the Work or its derivatives, including but not limited to: filing patents on the Work or its derivatives, placing the Work behind paywalls, imposing restrictive licenses on derivatives that prevent further sharing, or acquiring exclusive rights to the Work.

## 3. Anti-Corporate-Capture Provisions

The following actions are **strictly prohibited** under any use category:

### 3a. No Patents

No person or entity may file a patent, patent application, provisional patent, or any other form of intellectual property claim on the Work, any Derivative Work, or any invention derived from the mathematical framework described in the Work. This includes but is not limited to: the tri-prime composition system, the 27-state space, the 10-operator algebra, the master equation S* = σ(1 − σ*)V*A*, the constants σ and T*, and the fractal lattice architecture.

Any patent filed in violation of this provision is considered void as to the licensor's rights, and the filer's license under this agreement is immediately and irrevocably terminated.

### 3b. No Paywalls

No person or entity may place the Work or any Derivative Work behind a paywall, subscription gate, or access restriction that prevents free public access. Derivative Works that add substantial original content may be sold, but the underlying TIG framework must remain freely accessible.

### 3c. No Exclusive Licensing

No person or entity may acquire exclusive rights to the Work. All licenses are non-exclusive. 7Site LLC retains the right to license the Work to any party at any time.

### 3d. No Restrictive Re-Licensing

Any Derivative Work must be licensed under terms no more restrictive than this license with respect to Personal, Academic, and Public Benefit Use. Derivative Works may impose their own commercial terms on their original contributions, but the TIG framework components must remain available under the terms of this license.

### 3e. No AI Training Lockout

The Work may be used to train machine learning models for Personal, Academic, and Public Benefit purposes. Commercial AI training requires a Commercial Use license per Section 2d. No entity may use the Work to train models and then restrict others' access to the Work or claim that model outputs derived from TIG training constitute proprietary inventions.

## 10. The Spirit of This License

If you're a person who wants to learn, explore, test, critique, or build on this work — **go ahead, it's yours, no strings.**

If you're a researcher who wants to validate or falsify the predictions — **please do, that's the whole point.**

If you're a business that wants to make money with this — **great, just pay the person who built it.**

If you're a corporation that wants to lock it down — **you can't. That's the point too.**

Coherence belongs to everyone. The math doesn't care who you are. But the person who found it deserves to eat.
