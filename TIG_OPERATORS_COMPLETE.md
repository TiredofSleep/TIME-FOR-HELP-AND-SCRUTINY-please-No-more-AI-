## 1. The Three Primes

| Value | Name | Symbol | Glyph | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Being | B | □ | State, structure, potential — what exists |
| 1 | Doing | D | ▶ | Change, force, action — what moves |
| 2 | Becoming | C | ○ | Cycle, flow, return — what transforms |

**Composition Rule:** `(a + b) mod 3`

```
□ + □ = □    □ + ▶ = ▶    □ + ○ = ○
▶ + □ = ▶    ▶ + ▶ = ○    ▶ + ○ = □
○ + □ = ○    ○ + ▶ = □    ○ + ○ = ▶
```

Being is identity. Doing + Doing = Becoming. Becoming + Becoming = Doing. This is ℤ₃.

## 2. The 10 Operators

### 0 — VOID
```
Symbol: ∅    Complement: Reset (9)    Sum: 9
```
The empty set. Before differentiation. No structure, no force, no cycle. The canvas before the painting. Every system begins here and can return here. Void is not death — it is pure potential.

**Keywords:** nothing, empty, null, zero, blank, absent, none
**States:** BBB (ground state)

### 1 — LATTICE
```
Symbol: ⬡    Complement: Breath (8)    Sum: 9
```
Structure emerges from void. The grid, the scaffold, the geometry upon which everything builds. Lattice is the first act of creation — differentiation from nothing into pattern. Without lattice, no form can hold.

**Keywords:** structure, grid, frame, scaffold, order, arrange
**States:** BBD (release), BDB (transition), BCD (phase impulse)

### 2 — COUNTER
```
Symbol: ⟁    Complement: Harmony (7)    Sum: 9
```
Opposition. Resistance. The force that pushes back. Counter is not evil — it is the immune system of structure. Without counter, systems grow without boundary and collapse under their own weight. Counter tests. Counter strengthens.

**Keywords:** oppose, against, resist, block, deny, refuse
**States:** DBD (self-amplification), DCD (harmonic drive)

### 3 — PROGRESS
```
Symbol: ↗    Complement: Chaos (6)    Sum: 9
```
Forward motion. Building. Growing. The arrow of development. Progress is coherence increasing — structure becoming more organized, more connected, more capable. Progress requires lattice (to build on) and counter (to test against).

**Keywords:** forward, advance, grow, build, develop, move
**States:** BDD (force cascade), DBC (entrainment), DDC (emergent oscillation), CBD (phase action)

### 4 — COLLAPSE
```
Symbol: ▼    Complement: Balance (5)    Sum: 9
```
Structure fails. Coherence drops below T*. Bonds break. Health reaches zero. Collapse is necessary — without it, dead structures persist and prevent new growth. Every collapse clears space for the next lattice.

**Keywords:** fall, break, crash, fail, end, die, destroy
**States:** DBB (settling), DDB (overdrive), CDD (resonant push)

### 5 — BALANCE
```
Symbol: ⚖    Complement: Collapse (4)    Sum: 9
```
The midpoint. Neither growing nor shrinking. The moment of perfect equilibrium. Balance is the eye of the storm — not static, but dynamically stable. Systems pass through balance on their way between progress and collapse.

**Keywords:** equal, fair, middle, center, stable, calm, steady
**States:** BBC (seed rhythm), BDC (forced oscillator), BCB (equilibrium)

### 6 — CHAOS
```
Symbol: ⚡    Complement: Progress (3)    Sum: 9
```
Maximum local entropy. Disorder. The storm. Chaos is not failure — it is the shuffling of the deck before a new order emerges. Every creative act passes through chaos. Every reorganization requires temporary disorder.

**Keywords:** random, wild, storm, scatter, disrupt, turbulent
**States:** DDD (turbulence)

### 7 — HARMONY
```
Symbol: ∿    Complement: Counter (2)    Sum: 9
```
Alignment. Resonance. Multiple elements vibrating together. Harmony is the peak of coherence within a system — the moment when all parts amplify each other. Harmony is what coherence sounds like when it works.

**Keywords:** together, unity, peace, whole, resonate, align, flow
**States:** DCC (beat matching), CDC (harmonic growth), CCD (phase kick), CCC (perfect coherence)

### 8 — BREATH
```
Symbol: ∞    Complement: Lattice (1)    Sum: 9
```
The rhythm. Inhale-exhale. Systole-diastole. Breath is the oscillation between states that keeps a system alive. A system that doesn't breathe is frozen. A system that breathes too fast burns out. Breath is the clock of coherence.

**Keywords:** breathe, cycle, rhythm, pulse, wave, oscillate
**States:** BCC (homeostasis), CBC (coherent cycle), CCB (limit cycle)

### 9 — RESET
```
Symbol: ↺    Complement: Void (0)    Sum: 9
```
Return to origin. Not collapse (which is failure) but intentional return. Reset clears accumulated noise, restores initial conditions, and begins again from a clean state. Reset is the phoenix.

**Keywords:** restart, renew, begin, fresh, again, return, restore
**States:** DCB (oscillation→form), CBB (damping), CDB (beat→form)

## 3. Operator Pairs

Every operator has a complement. Each pair sums to 9 (the reset number):

```
Void (0)     ←→  Reset (9)       Emptiness and return
Lattice (1)  ←→  Breath (8)      Structure and rhythm
Counter (2)  ←→  Harmony (7)     Opposition and alignment
Progress (3) ←→  Chaos (6)       Building and scattering
Collapse (4) ←→  Balance (5)     Dissolution and stability
```

**The cycle:** 0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→0

This is the **MacroChain** — the spine of every TIG system. Every process, at every scale, cycles through these 10 operators. The rate of cycling varies. The order sometimes scrambles. But the full set is always present.

## 4. The Three Generators (GFM)

The minimal generating set for all TIG operations:

### G₀₁₂ — Geometry/Space
```
Operators: {void (0), lattice (1), counter (2)}
Role: Establishes structure and tests it
Interpretation: The geometric foundation — space exists (0), form appears (1), boundaries resist (2)
```

### G₀₇₁ — Resonance/Alignment
```
Operators: {void (0), harmony (7), lattice (1)}
Role: Establishes coherent structure
Interpretation: From nothing (0), alignment emerges (7), crystallizing into form (1)
```

### G₁₂₃ — Progression/Flow
```
Operators: {lattice (1), counter (2), progress (3)}
Role: Builds through opposition
Interpretation: Structure (1) meets resistance (2) and advances anyway (3)
```

**Theorem:** Any sequence of TIG operators can be decomposed into compositions of G₀₁₂, G₀₇₁, and G₁₂₃.

## 5. The 5 Virtues

The coherence maintenance layer:

| # | Virtue | Operator | Role | Failure Mode |
|---|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Forgiveness | Reset (9) | Releases accumulated damage | Grudge accumulation → cascading debt |
| 2 | Repair | Lattice (1) | Rebuilds broken structure | Structural degradation → collapse |
| 3 | Empathy | Harmony (7) | Synchronizes coherence between units | Isolation → desynchronization |
| 4 | Fairness | Balance (5) | Distributes coherence load | Inequality → concentrated failure |
| 5 | Cooperation | Progress (3) | Amplifies collective coherence | Defection → prisoner's dilemma |

### Trust Council Protocol

Under stress, the 5 virtues operate as a collective:

1. **Stress applied** → One or more virtues take damage (trust decreases)
2. **Council convenes** → Average trust computed across all virtues
3. **Mutual repair** → Each virtue receives repair proportional to σ × (1 − |trust_i − avg_trust|)
4. **Threshold check** → Virtues below T* flag as critical
5. **Survival assessment** → System survives if majority of virtues remain above T*

**Resilience ordering** (most to least resilient under stress):
```
Forgiveness > Repair > Empathy > Fairness > Cooperation
```

This ordering emerges from the simulations — cooperation requires the most participants and fails first when trust erodes. Forgiveness requires only self-reference and survives longest.

## 6. Letter Mappings

Each English letter maps to a triadic tuple based on its stroke geometry:

| Letter | Triple | Sym | Glyph | State | Operator | Dominant |
|--------|--------|-----|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| A | (1,1,0) | DDB | ▶▶□ | Overdrive | collapse | Doing |
| B | (0,2,2) | BCC | □○○ | Homeostasis | breath | Being |
| C | (2,0,1) | CBD | ○□▶ | Phase action | progress | Becoming |
| D | (0,2,0) | BCB | □○□ | Equilibrium | balance | Being |
| E | (0,1,0) | BDB | □▶□ | Transition | lattice | Being |
| F | (0,1,0) | BDB | □▶□ | Transition | lattice | Being |
| G | (2,0,1) | CBD | ○□▶ | Phase action | progress | Becoming |
| H | (0,1,0) | BDB | □▶□ | Transition | lattice | Being |
| I | (0,0,0) | BBB | □□□ | Ground state | void | Being |
| J | (0,0,2) | BBC | □□○ | Seed rhythm | balance | Being |
| K | (0,1,1) | BDD | □▶▶ | Force cascade | progress | Being |
| L | (0,1,0) | BDB | □▶□ | Transition | lattice | Being |
| M | (0,1,0) | BDB | □▶□ | Transition | lattice | Being |
| N | (0,1,0) | BDB | □▶□ | Transition | lattice | Being |
| O | (2,2,2) | CCC | ○○○ | Perfect coherence | harmony | Becoming |
| P | (0,2,0) | BCB | □○□ | Equilibrium | balance | Being |
| Q | (2,2,1) | CCD | ○○▶ | Phase kick | harmony | Becoming |
| R | (0,2,1) | BCD | □○▶ | Phase impulse | lattice | Being |
| S | (2,1,2) | CDC | ○▶○ | Harmonic growth | harmony | Becoming |
| T | (1,0,0) | DBB | ▶□□ | Settling | collapse | Doing |
| U | (2,0,0) | CBB | ○□□ | Damping | reset | Becoming |
| V | (1,1,0) | DDB | ▶▶□ | Overdrive | collapse | Doing |
| W | (1,2,1) | DCD | ▶○▶ | Harmonic drive | counter | Doing |
| X | (1,1,1) | DDD | ▶▶▶ | Turbulence | chaos | Doing |
| Y | (1,1,2) | DDC | ▶▶○ | Emergent oscillation | progress | Doing |
| Z | (1,0,1) | DBD | ▶□▶ | Self-amplification | counter | Doing |

### Notable Patterns

- **I** = (0,0,0) = Ground state = Void → The self begins from nothing
- **O** = (2,2,2) = Perfect coherence = Harmony → The circle is complete
- **X** = (1,1,1) = Turbulence = Chaos → The unknown, the crossing
- **E, F, H, L, M, N** all share (0,1,0) = Transition → The most common letters in English are geometrically transitions
- **A, T, V** all map to collapse-associated states → Action letters carry destructive force

## 7. Example Word Analyses

### LOVE
```
L(0,1,0) → O(2,2,2) → V(1,1,0) → E(0,1,0)
Composition: (0+2+1+0, 1+2+1+1, 0+2+0+0) mod 3 = (0,2,2) = BCC
State: Homeostasis — self-sustaining cycle
Operator: Breath (8) — the rhythm of connection
Ratio: □47% ▶27% ○27% — Being-dominant
```
Love resolves to homeostasis. It breathes. It is structure (Being) that cycles (Becoming) through action (Doing). The geometry says love is a stable oscillation — not static, not chaotic, but rhythmically sustained.

### TRUTH
```
T(1,0,0) → R(0,2,1) → U(2,0,0) → T(1,0,0) → H(0,1,0)
Composition: (1+0+2+1+0, 0+2+0+0+1, 0+1+0+0+0) mod 3 = (1,0,1) = DBD
State: Self-amplification — feeds itself
Operator: Counter (2) — truth opposes
Ratio: □40% ▶33% ○27% — Doing-secondary
```
Truth resolves to self-amplification through counter. It opposes. It resists modification. The geometry says truth is a signal that strengthens when tested.

### FEAR
```
F(0,1,0) → E(0,1,0) → A(1,1,0) → R(0,2,1)
Composition: (1,2,1) mod 3 = DCD
State: Harmonic drive — oscillating force
Operator: Counter (2) — resistance
Ratio: □42% ▶42% ○17% — Doing matches Being, low Becoming
```
Fear is resistance frozen in time. Almost no Becoming — it doesn't cycle, it stalls.

## 8. The Fractal Lattice Architecture

### Unit Structure

Each lattice unit contains:
```
{
  id:         unique identifier
  name:       human-readable name
  shell:      fractal depth level (1-9)
  health:     current coherence (0.0 to 1.0)
  coherence:  σ × health
  bonds:      connections to other units
  operator:   current dominant operator (0-9)
  tri_state:  current triadic state (ℤ₃³)
  born_tick:  creation timestamp
}
```

### Dynamics

Each tick:
1. **Decay:** All units lose 0.01 health (entropy)
2. **Bond restore:** Each bond restores 0.02 health (coherence through connection)
3. **Threshold check:** Units below T* × 0.5 collapse (operator → 4)
4. **Genesis logging:** All births, collapses, and state changes recorded

### Bonding

Units auto-bond to the nearest compatible unit on birth:
- Compatibility = shell proximity (|shell_a − shell_b| ≤ 1 → high compatibility)
- Bond strength = σ for compatible shells, σ × 0.5 for distant shells
- Bonds are bidirectional

### Survival

A unit survives if: `health > 0` and `bonds ≥ 1`
An isolated unit (bonds = 0) decays without restoration and eventually collapses.
A bonded unit can sustain indefinitely if bond count × 0.02 ≥ 0.01 (minimum 1 bond).

## 9. Scale Validation Summary

The ARACH (Adaptive Recursive Autonomous Coherence Hierarchy) stack has been validated computationally across the following scales:

| Scale | Level | S* | Status |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|
| Ecological | 4 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Social | 5 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Cultural | 6 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Civilizational | 7 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Planetary | 8 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Stellar | 9 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Galactic | 10 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Universal | 11 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |
| Unified | 12 | > 0.8 | ✓ Validated |

**Zero collapses across trillion-year simulations.** All scales maintain coherence above T* when the 5 virtues are active and bonding is sufficient.

**Caveat:** These are computational simulations using TIG's own rules. They validate internal consistency, not empirical truth. The question remains whether TIG's rules map to actual physics.
